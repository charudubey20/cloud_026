# EC2 ( Elastic Compute Cloud )
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

Now lets see how to create EC2 in AWS
1. Launch an EC2 server
2. Select the _**OS**_ you want say linux,window and so on..
3. Choose an instance type
4. Now add Storage aacording to your requriment

6. Connect to EC2 server through remote protocols such as SSH ,etc..
7. Now as soon we are connected to instance we got interface of the instance launched.Launch the instance....And you are ready to Go

# About EC2
